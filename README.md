# 42School Libft
This project let you start with the first project of 42School cursus.
The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you‚Äôll be allowed to use in all your other projects.

You'll be quickly able to setup your project by [creating all the needed .c files](#project-setup) and [testing your functions](#project-check) with the tester folder after checking the norm.

Let's get a closer look at everyhting.

## The libft folder
This folder contains my full libft project with all the functions and bonuses. I suggest you to use it as a reference to compare your code with mine but don't copy it or you'll get a 0.

## The tester
This folder contains a tester for the libft project. It will help you to check the norm and test your functions. You can find more information about it in the [tester README](tester/README.md).

## helper.py
This script will help you with different tasks:
- Create all the needed .c files for the project and setup the environment.
- Test your functions with the tester folder after checking the norm.

### How to use it?
After cloning the repo, you'll need to run the script with the following command

#### Project setup
```sh
python3 helper.py setup
```
This command will create all the needed .c files for the project and setup the environment. Inside the `libft-dev` folder.

If you want to create the files in a different folder, you can use the `-p` option to specify the path. For example, if you want to create the files in the `~/Desktop` folder, you can run the following command:
```sh
python3 helper.py setup -p ~/Desktop
```

If you want to create the files for the bonus part as well, you can use the `--bonus` argument. For example let's setup the project with the bonus part included:
```sh
python3 helper.py setup --bonus
```

#### Project check
After you've finished coding your project, you can use the script to check the norm and test your functions with the tester folder. To do so, you can run the following command:
```sh
python3 helper.py check
```

If you want to extend the check to the bonus part as well, you can use the `--bonus` argument. Example:
```sh
python3 helper.py check --bonus
```

If you want to check the norm without testing your functions, you can use the `--no-test` argument. Example:
```sh
python3 helper.py check --no-test
```

**Note:** Be sure to have norminette installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can install it with the following command:
```sh
pip3 install norminette
```
