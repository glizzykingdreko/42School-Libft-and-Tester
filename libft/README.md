# My Libft
This is my libft project for 42 school. It contains all the functions and bonuses. I suggest you to use it as a reference to compare your code with mine but don't copy it or you'll get a 0.

Take a look into the [tester](../tester/) folder, you'll find a tester for the libft project. It will help you to check the norm and test your functions. You can find more information about it in the [tester README](../tester/README.md).

You can find the subject of the project [here](../en.subject.pdf).
